Acme is a programmer's text editor, shell, and user interface. It runs on a virtualized operating system, Inferno, that runs hosted on Windows, Linux, Solaris, and MacOSX.

This repository contains all the source code to build Acme SAC.

Please send patches to acme-sac@googlegroups.com, or join the [maillist](http://groups.google.com/group/acme-sac) to discuss bugs and features.

You can build the limbo source tree from inside acme:

  % cd /appl/
  % mk install
```
